        n=n//2
     return binary
step3:end
    

2.Scenario: A function needs to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list
efficiently.
Write logic to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list.


use two pointer method-logic
step1:declare i and j two variable for iterate the two list.i for first array list and j for second array list
step2:declare another variable k to store the sorted list.
step3:compare i and j
    while i<len(list1) and j<len(list2):
    if i<j:
        k.append(list1[i])
    else:
        k.append(list2[j]
step4:return the k.
                 


3.Scenario: A function needs to find the first non-repeating character in a string for
text processing.
Write logic to find the first non-repeating character in a given string.

step3:return the character
                 
                 
5. Scenario: A program needs to identify common elements between two lists for
data filtering.
Write logic to find the common elements between two lists.                 
                 
step1:Lets take list1 as x and list2 as y
step2:print(x&y)
                 
6.Scenario: A function is required to reverse a given number.
Write logic to reverse a given number.                 

step1:count the number 'n'
step2:while n!=0:
         rem=n%10
         rev=(rev*10)+rem
         n=n/10
step3:return the n
                 
                 
                 
7.Scenario: A program needs to count the number of words in a given sentence.
Write logic to count the number of words in a given sentence.

                 
step1:use sentence=sentence.strip()  #to remove the space
step2:words=sentence.split()  #split the sentence
step3:count the number of words. word_count- len(words)
step4:return word_count 
                 
                 
8.Scenario: A function needs to compute the factorial of a number using iteration
instead of recursion.
                 
def factorial_iter(n):
                 #step1:handle edge case
                 if n<0:
                     return "factorial is not defined for negative numbers"
                 if n==0 or n==1:
                     return 1
                 #step2:
                 result=1
                 for i in range(2,n+1)
                     result=result*i  
                 #step3:
                 return result
           

9.Scenario: A program is required to convert all strings in a list to uppercase.
Write logic to convert all strings in a list to uppercase.                 
                 
                 
step1:create an empty list to store results
step2:Go through each string in the original list
step3:convert each string to uppercase using .upper()
step4:add the uppercase string to the new list
step5:return the new list
                 
 
10. Scenario: A function is needed to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD)
